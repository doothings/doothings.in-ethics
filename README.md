CLEAN UP
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* You are expected to cleanup the table after you leave.
  That would mean that you leave the table in the same state that you found it

MAKE SPACE (pun intended) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* If the area per person is on the decline on a given day, you are expected to make space for others.
* This includes and is not limited to sharing power plugs, working area, common resources(like boards, soldering stations, etc)
