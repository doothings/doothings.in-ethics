CLEAN UP
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* You are expected to cleanup the table after you leave.
  That would mean that you leave the table in the same state that you found it

MAKE SPACE (pun intended) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* If the area per person is on the decline on a given day, you are expected to make space for others.
* This includes and is not limited to sharing power plugs, working area, common resources(like boards, soldering stations, etc)

DISCUSSIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* While we appreciate and welcome healthy discussions but at the same time you are expected to make it happen in isolation making sure not disturbing others.

SOFTWARE PIRACY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* We are a community and we promote [Free and Open Source Softwares](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software).
